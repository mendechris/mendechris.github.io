## The start
I can't say that I've always been interested in programming. For a long time, I thought the internet and computers were mystical things that operated magically and any task involving a terminal could break the whole thing. 

My first experience with programming was in 2011, when I took Introduction to Computer Science I. At the time, I didnâ€™t know what to expect. The topic seemed interesting enough and I needed a course to fulfill my degree requirements. I had no idea what Java was and thought Javascript was just what they called the Java code. Eventually, I learned that they are not the same and that semester I began my first foray into Java programming.


## Interests



## Goals for the Future
For the immediate future, my goals are to do well in this class. Most of my experience in programming involves using a CLI to run code. I would like to create an app that others can use.
