## Javascript Impressions

This semester isn’t the first time I’ve learned Javascript through FreeCodeCamp. I started the Javascript section about a year ago when I needed a crash course in Javascript basics to participate in a hackathon. Since Java was my first programming language, I found the transition to Javascript easy. The commands may have been slightly different but the logic was the same. 

I did learn a few new concepts in the ES6 reading section.  The methods to iterate over arrays and objects without having to use the array indices is a nice feature that I'm sure will be useful in the future.

One of the features I like about Javascript is the dynamic type checking. It is very convenient to be able to declare variables with ```let``` or ```const``` without having to worry about explicitly including the data type. Additionally, the ability to return multiple data types for a function allows for flexibility, unlike Java. Of course, I could see how this flexibility could be a disadvantage. For example, it would be very easy to change a variable that's initially an array into an integer which could accidentally break your program. 

## Javascript: Need to Know

I don't like to label tools like language as "good" or "bad" since every language was useful at some point. From my limited experience, I think that Javascript is an extremely useful programming language for software engineering. Because of its prevalence in the Tech Industry, many frameworks use Javascript; it is much easier to work with a language that has an extensive library than to work with one that is not as well-supported. Javascript is also useful because it can be used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) which allows us to dynamically access data and update information as needed. 

## WOD Is This All For?

Before this class, I had never heard of Athletic Software Engineering (ASE). After reading Dr. Johnson's essay on the subject, my initial reaction was apprehension. "High-Intensity" and "Stress-inducing" are not usually descriptors of things I enjoy. However, I can appreciate the reason for the ASE approach. Reading about programming is certainly not the same as actually programming and using WODs to build competency makes sense.

I find the practice WODs to be very useful. While the stakes are not as high, the practice WODs have allowed me to prepare for the expectations of the in-class WODs. Additionally, it is helpful to have a tool to assess what I do (or don't) know. 

## Final Thoughts

While I am more accustomed to the traditional teaching approach, I believe that ASE will be more beneficial for this class. It is stressful, but I think performing well under stressful conditions will make my accomplishments more enjoyable.
