## Javascript Impressions:

This semester isn’t the first time I’ve learned Javascript through FreeCodeCamp. I started the Javascript section about a year ago when I needed a crash course in Javascript basics to participate in a hackathon. Since Java was my first programming language, I found the transition to Javascript was easy. The commands may have been slightly different but the logic was the same.

I did learn a few new concepts in the ES6 reading section.  The methods to iterate over arrays and objects without having to use the array indices is a nice feature that I'm sure will be useful in the future.

One of the features I like about Javascript is the dynamic type checking. It is very convenient to be able to declare variables with ```let``` or ```const``` without having to worry about explicitly including the data type. Additionally, the ability to return multiple data types for a function allows for flexibility, unlike Java. Of course, I could see how this flexibility could be a disadvantage. For example, it would be very easy to change a variable that's initially an array into an integer which could accidentally break your program.

## Javascript for Software Engineering

From my limited experience, I think that Java is a good programming language for software engineering.
