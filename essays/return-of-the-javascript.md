## Javascript Impressions:

This semester isn’t the first time I’ve learned Javascript through FreeCodeCamp. I needed a crash course in Javascript basics to participate in a hackathon and it was the best option I had found. Having started with Java, I found the transition to be very easy. The commands may have been slightly different but the logic was the same.

Since I hadn’t done much with Javascript after the hackathon event, I did forget the exact syntax for some of the tasks. Luckily, Javascript is not too difficult to relearn when compared with C, C++, or Java. 

I did learn a few new concepts in the ES6 reading section.  The methods to iterate over arrays and objects without having to use the array indices is a nice feature that I'm sure will be useful in the future.

One of the features I like about Javascript is the dynamic type checking. It is very convenient to be able to declare variables with ```let``` or ```const``` without having to worry about explicitly including the data type. Additionally, being able to return multiple data types for a function allows for flexibility unlike Java.
