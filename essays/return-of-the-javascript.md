## The Start of It All

I can't say that I've always been interested in programming. For a long time, I thought the internet and computers were mystical things that operated magically and anything involving a terminal could break the whole thing. 

My first experience with programming was in 2011, when I took Introduction to Computer Science I. At the time, I didn’t know what to expect. The topic seemed interesting enough and I needed a course to fulfill my degree requirements. I had no idea what Java was and thought Javascript was just what they called the Java code. Eventually, I learned that they are not the same and that semester I began my first foray into Java programming.

## Javascript Impressions: Then and Now

This semester isn’t the first time I’ve learned Javascript through FreeCodeCamp. I needed a crash course in Javascript basics to participate in a hackathon and it was the best option I had found. Having started with Java, I found the transition to be very easy. The commands may have been slightly different but the logic was the same.

Since I hadn’t done much with Javascript after the hackathon event, I did forget the exact syntax for some of the tasks. Luckily, Javascript is not too difficult to relearn when compared with C, C++, or Java. 

One of the features I like about Javascript is the dynamic type checking. It is very convenient to be able to declare variables with ```let``` or ```const``` without having to worry about explicitly including the data type. Furthermore this allows us to return multiple data types for a function than to be limited.
