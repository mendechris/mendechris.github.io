## Javascript Impressions

This semester isn’t the first time I’ve learned Javascript through FreeCodeCamp. I started the Javascript section about a year ago when I needed a crash course in Javascript basics to participate in a hackathon. Since Java was my first programming language, I found the transition to Javascript was easy. The commands may have been slightly different but the logic was the same. 

I did learn a few new concepts in the ES6 reading section.  The methods to iterate over arrays and objects without having to use the array indices is a nice feature that I'm sure will be useful in the future.

One of the features I like about Javascript is the dynamic type checking. It is very convenient to be able to declare variables with ```let``` or ```const``` without having to worry about explicitly including the data type. Additionally, the ability to return multiple data types for a function allows for flexibility, unlike Java. Of course, I could see how this flexibility could be a disadvantage. For example, it would be very easy to change a variable that's initially an array into an integer which could accidentally break your program. 

## Javascript: Need to Know

I don't like to label tools like language as 'good' or 'bad' since every language was useful at some point. From my limited experience, I think that Javascript is an extremely useful programming language for software engineering. Because of its prevalence in the Tech Industry, there are many frameworks that use Javascript; it is much easier to work with a language that has an extensive library than to work with one that is not as well-supported. Javascript is also useful because it can be used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) which allows us to dynamically access data and update pages as needed.
