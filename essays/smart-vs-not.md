## The goal
Most of the time when we ask question, the goal is to get an answer. Or is it? A useless answer wouldn't help. We'd be in the same position as if we didn't ask at all. Take the above comic, for example, we are presented with four legitimate answers, but which one is actually useful to the asker? As presented above, the question is much too broad and doesn't give any insight as to why the question is being asked. What's the end goal of knowing how many holes there are in a coffee cup?
